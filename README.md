### Installation
The code in this repository was created with the standard Anaconda distribution of Python. No additional libraries were utilised. There should be no issues running the code with Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
For this project I wanted to use AirBNB data from 2018 for the city of Seattle to answer some key questions that would need investigating if somebody were to consider investing in a rental property in the city.
1. What neighbourhood offers the highest returns.
2. What neighbourhood has the highest demand.
3. What amenities within a property have the greatest impact on price and demand

With the answers to these 3 questions, investors will hopefully be better informed when looking at potential property purchases.
